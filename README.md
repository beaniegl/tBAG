Text-Based Adventure Game in Java (Still a W.I.P)

A simple game demonstrating some basic uses of OOP principles, such as inheritance and polymorphism. Still ironing out some flaws.

To dplay - download the zipped folder and unzip.

From here, either:

1: Open the project in your favourite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.) and run the main class.

2: If you have Java installed, in your command line, change directory to the project files.

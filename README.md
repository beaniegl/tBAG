Text-Based Adventure Game in Java (Still a W.I.P)

A simple game demonstrating some basic uses of OOP principles, such as inheritance and polymorphism. Still ironing out some flaws.

To download - download the zip folder and unzip.

From here, either:

1: Open the project in your favourite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ etc.)

2: If you have Java installed, in your command line, change directory to the project files.
